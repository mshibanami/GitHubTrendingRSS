&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;About the book&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The availability of foundation models has transformed AI from a specialized discipline into a powerful development tool everyone can use. This book covers the end-to-end process of adapting foundation models to solve real-world problems, encompassing tried-and-true techniques from other engineering fields and techniques emerging with foundation models.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/49j1cGS&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiphuyen/aie-book/main/assets/aie-cover.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/49j1cGS&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiphuyen/aie-book/main/assets/aie-cover-back.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book is available on:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/49j1cGS&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5719111/2146021/15173&quot;&gt;O&#39;Reilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3Vq2ryu&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;and most places where technical books are sold.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is NOT a tutorial book, so it doesn&#39;t have a lot of code snippets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;What this book is about&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book provides a framework for adapting foundation models, which include both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs), to specific applications. It not only outlines various solutions for building an AI application but also raises questions you can ask to evaluate the best solution for your needs. Here are just some of the many questions that this book can help you answer:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Should I build this AI application?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How do I evaluate my application? Can I use AI to evaluate AI outputs?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;What causes hallucinations? How do I detect and mitigate hallucinations?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;What are the best practices for prompt engineering?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Why does RAG work? What are the strategies for doing RAG?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;What’s an agent? How do I build and evaluate an agent?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;When to finetune a model? When not to finetune a model?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How much data do I need? How do I validate the quality of my data?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How do I make my model faster, cheaper, and secure?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How do I create a feedback loop to improve my application continually?&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book will also help you navigate the overwhelming AI landscape: types of models, evaluation benchmarks, and a seemingly infinite number of use cases and application patterns.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The content in this book is illustrated using actual case studies, many of which I’ve worked on, backed by ample references and extensively reviewed by experts from a wide range of backgrounds. Even though the book took two years to write, it draws from my experience working with language models and ML systems from the last decade.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like my previous book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4fXVZH2&quot;&gt;Designing Machine Learning Systems (DMLS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this book focuses on the fundamentals of AI engineering instead of any specific tool or API. Tools become outdated quickly, but fundamentals should last longer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;AI Engineering&lt;/em&gt; (AIE) with &lt;em&gt;Designing Machine Learning Systems&lt;/em&gt; (DMLS)&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AIE can be a companion to DMLS. DMLS focuses on building applications on top of traditional ML models, which involves more tabular data annotations, feature engineering, and model training. AIE focuses on building applications on top of foundation models, which involves more prompt engineering, context construction, and parameter-efficient finetuning. Both books are self-contained and modular, so you can read either book independently.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since foundation models are ML models, some concepts are relevant to working with both. If a topic is relevant to AIE but has been discussed extensively in DMLS, it’ll still be covered in this book, but to a lesser extent, with pointers to relevant resources.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note that many topics are covered in DMLS but not in AIE, and vice versa. The first chapter of this book also covers the differences between traditional ML engineering and AI engineering.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A real-world system often involves both traditional ML models and foundation models, so knowledge about working with both is often necessary.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Who this book is for&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is for anyone who wants to leverage foundation models to solve real-world problems. This is a technical book, so the language of this book is geared towards technical roles, including AI engineers, ML engineers, data scientists, engineering managers, and technical product managers. This book is for you if you can relate to one of the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;You’re building or optimizing an AI application, whether you’re starting from scratch or looking to move beyond the demo phase into a production-ready stage. You may also be facing issues like hallucinations, security, latency, or costs, and need targeted solutions.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;You want to streamline your team’s AI development process, making it more systematic, faster, and reliable.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;You want to understand how your organization can leverage foundation models to improve the business’s bottom line and how to build a team to do so.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also benefit from the book if you belong to one of the following groups:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Tool developers who want to identify underserved areas in AI engineering to position your products in the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Researchers who want to understand better AI use cases.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Job candidates seeking clarity on the skills needed to pursue a career as an AI engineer.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Anyone wanting to better understand AI&#39;s capabilities and limitations, and how it might affect different roles.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I love getting to the bottom of things, so some sections dive a bit deeper into the technical side. While many early readers like the detail, I know it might not be for everyone. I’ll give you a heads-up before things get too technical. Feel free to skip ahead if it feels a little too in the weeds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book would&#39;ve taken a lot longer to write and missed many important topics if it wasn&#39;t for so many wonderful people who helped me through the process.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because the timeline for the project was tight—two years for a 150,000-word book that covers so much ground—I&#39;m grateful to the technical reviewers who put aside their precious time to review this book so quickly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/luke_metz&quot;&gt;Luke Metz&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing soundboard who checked my assumptions and prevented me from going down the wrong path. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanchunglee/&quot;&gt;Han-chung Lee&lt;/a&gt;, always up to date with the latest AI news and community development, pointed me toward resources that I missed. Luke and Han were the first to review my drafts before I sent them to the next round of technical reviewers, and I&#39;m forever indebted to them for tolerating my follies and mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned so much from the online discussions with so many. Thanks to everyone who&#39;s ever answered my questions, commented on my posts, or sent me an email with your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the book wouldn&#39;t have been possible without the team at O&#39;Reilly, especially my development editors (Melissa Potter, Corbin Collins, Jill Leonard) and my production editors (Kristen Brown and Elizabeth Kelly). Liz Wheeler is the most discerning editor I&#39;ve ever worked with. Nicole Butterfield is a force who oversaw this book from an idea to a final product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book, after all, is an accumulation of invaluable lessons I learned throughout my career. I owe these lessons to my extremely competent and patient coworkers and former coworkers. Every person I&#39;ve worked with has taught me something new about bringing ML into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;1. Quick Starts&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/&quot;&gt;quickstarts section&lt;/a&gt; contains step-by-step tutorials to get you started with Gemini and learn about its specific features.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To begin, you&#39;ll need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A Google account.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;An API key (create one in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey&quot;&gt;Google AI Studio&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We recommend starting with the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-gemini/cookbook/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb&quot;&gt;Authentication&lt;/a&gt;: Set up your API key for access.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-gemini/cookbook/main/quickstarts/Get_started.ipynb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Get started with Gemini models and the Gemini API, covering basic prompting and multimodal input. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, explore the other quickstarts tutorials to learn about individual features:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;2. Examples (Practical Use Cases)&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These examples demonstrate how to combine multiple Gemini API features or 3rd-party tools to build more complex applications.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-gemini/cookbook/main/examples/Browser_as_a_tool.ipynb&quot;&gt;Browser as a tool&lt;/a&gt;: Use a web browser for live and internal (intranet) web interactions&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/examples/&quot;&gt;many many more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;3. Demos (End-to-End Applications)&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These fully functional, end-to-end applications showcase the power of Gemini in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-quickstart&quot;&gt;Gemini API quickstart&lt;/a&gt;: Python Flask App running with the Google AI Gemini API, designed to get you started building with Gemini&#39;s multi-modal capabilities&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Official SDKs&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Gemini API is a REST API. You can call it directly using tools like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/rest/&quot;&gt;REST examples&lt;/a&gt; or the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postman.com/ai-on-postman/google-gemini-apis/overview&quot;&gt;Postman workspace&lt;/a&gt;), or use one of our official SDKs:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/generative-ai-go&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/generative-ai-js&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/generative-ai-dart&quot;&gt;Dart (Flutter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/generative-ai-android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift&quot;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Important: Migration&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With Gemini 2 we are offering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai&quot;&gt;new SDK&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/&quot;&gt;google-genai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;v1.0&lt;/code&gt;). The updated SDK is fully compatible with all Gemini API models and features, including recent additions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aistudio.google.com/live&quot;&gt;live API&lt;/a&gt; (audio + video streaming), improved tool usage ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution?lang=python&quot;&gt;code execution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling/tutorial?lang=python&quot;&gt;function calling&lt;/a&gt; and integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding?lang=python&quot;&gt;Google search grounding&lt;/a&gt;), and media generation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen&quot;&gt;Imagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video&quot;&gt;Veo&lt;/a&gt;). This SDK allows you to connect to the Gemini API through either &lt;a href=&quot;https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-flash&quot;&gt;Google AI Studio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/gemini-v2&quot;&gt;Vertex AI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai&quot;&gt;google-generativeai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; package will continue to support the original Gemini models. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; also be used with Gemini 2 models, just with a limited feature set. All new features will be developed in the new Google GenAI SDK.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate&quot;&gt;migration guide&lt;/a&gt; for details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Get Help&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ask a question on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.ai.google.dev/&quot;&gt;Google AI Developer Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Gemini API on Google Cloud Vertex AI&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For enterprise developers, the Gemini API is also available on Google Cloud Vertex AI. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai&quot;&gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt; for examples.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buy the printed book through &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do&quot;&gt;O&#39;Reilly Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book was written and tested with Python 3.5, though other Python versions (including Python 2.7) should work in nearly all cases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipython.org&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://numpy.org&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org&quot;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org&quot;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org&quot;&gt;Scikit-Learn&lt;/a&gt;, and related packages. Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction to the language itself, see the free companion project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython&quot;&gt;A Whirlwind Tour of Python&lt;/a&gt;: it&#39;s a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and scientists.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb&quot;&gt;Index.ipynb&lt;/a&gt; for an index of the notebooks available to accompany the text.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The code in the book was tested with Python 3.5, though most (but not all) will also work correctly with Python 2.7 and other older Python versions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The packages I used to run the code in the book are listed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/master/requirements.txt&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/a&gt; (Note that some of these exact version numbers may not be available on your platform: you may have to tweak them for your own use). To install the requirements using &lt;a href=&quot;http://conda.pydata.org&quot;&gt;conda&lt;/a&gt;, run the following at the command-line:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ conda install --file requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To create a stand-alone environment named &lt;code&gt;PDSH&lt;/code&gt; with Python 3.5 and all the required package versions, run the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ conda create -n PDSH python=3.5 --file requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about using conda environments in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html&quot;&gt;Managing Environments&lt;/a&gt; section of the conda documentation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this curriculum, you will learn:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Different approaches to Artificial Intelligence, including the &quot;good old&quot; symbolic approach with &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Representation&lt;/strong&gt; and reasoning (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence&quot;&gt;GOFAI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/strong&gt;, which are at the core of modern AI. We will illustrate the concepts behind these important topics using code in two of the most popular frameworks - &lt;a href=&quot;http://Tensorflow.org&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pytorch.org&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Architectures&lt;/strong&gt; for working with images and text. We will cover recent models but may be a bit lacking in the state-of-the-art.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Less popular AI approaches, such as &lt;strong&gt;Genetic Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Multi-Agent Systems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What we will not cover in this curriculum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Business cases of using &lt;strong&gt;AI in Business&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/introduction-ai-for-business-users/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Introduction to AI for business users&lt;/a&gt; learning path on Microsoft Learn, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/ai/ai-business-school/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;AI Business School&lt;/a&gt;, developed in cooperation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insead.edu/&quot;&gt;INSEAD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classic Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt;, which is well described in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/Microsoft/ML-for-Beginners&quot;&gt;Machine Learning for Beginners Curriculum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Practical AI applications built using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Cognitive Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. For this, we recommend that you start with modules Microsoft Learn for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-computer-vision-solutions-azure-cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/explore-natural-language-processing/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;natural language processing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Generative AI with Azure OpenAI Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and others.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Specific ML &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Azure Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-fabric/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Microsoft Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/data-engineer-azure-databricks?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Azure Databricks&lt;/a&gt;. Consider using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Build and operate machine learning solutions with Azure Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-operate-machine-learning-solutions-azure-databricks/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Build and Operate Machine Learning Solutions with Azure Databricks&lt;/a&gt; learning paths.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversational AI&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chat Bots&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a separate &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-conversational-ai-solutions/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Create conversational AI solutions&lt;/a&gt; learning path, and you can also refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://soshnikov.com/azure/hello-bot-conversational-ai-on-microsoft-platform/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt; behind deep learning. For this, we would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618&quot;&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, which is also available online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deeplearningbook.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.deeplearningbook.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The executable notebook also contains a lot of theoretical material, so to understand the topic you need to go through at least one version of the notebook (either PyTorch or TensorFlow).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labs&lt;/strong&gt; available for some topics, which give you an opportunity to try applying the material you have learned to a specific problem.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repository contains the code for developing, pretraining, and finetuning a GPT-like LLM and is the official code repository for the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4fqvn0D&quot;&gt;Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://mng.bz/orYv&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;ll learn and understand how large language models (LLMs) work from the inside out by coding them from the ground up, step by step. In this book, I&#39;ll guide you through creating your own LLM, explaining each stage with clear text, diagrams, and examples.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The method described in this book for training and developing your own small-but-functional model for educational purposes mirrors the approach used in creating large-scale foundational models such as those behind ChatGPT. In addition, this book includes code for loading the weights of larger pretrained models for finetuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;The mental model below summarizes the contents covered in this book.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/mental-model.jpg&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The most important prerequisite is a strong foundation in Python programming. With this knowledge, you will be well prepared to explore the fascinating world of LLMs and understand the concepts and code examples presented in this book.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have some experience with deep neural networks, you may find certain concepts more familiar, as LLMs are built upon these architectures.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book uses PyTorch to implement the code from scratch without using any external LLM libraries. While proficiency in PyTorch is not a prerequisite, familiarity with PyTorch basics is certainly useful. If you are new to PyTorch, Appendix A provides a concise introduction to PyTorch. Alternatively, you may find my book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sebastianraschka.com/teaching/pytorch-1h/&quot;&gt;PyTorch in One Hour: From Tensors to Training Neural Networks on Multiple GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, helpful for learning about the essentials.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The code in the main chapters of this book is designed to run on conventional laptops within a reasonable timeframe and does not require specialized hardware. This approach ensures that a wide audience can engage with the material. Additionally, the code automatically utilizes GPUs if they are available. (Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/raw/main/setup/README.md&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; doc for additional recommendations.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Video Course&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/livevideo/master-and-build-large-language-models&quot;&gt;A 17-hour and 15-minute companion video course&lt;/a&gt; where I code through each chapter of the book. The course is organized into chapters and sections that mirror the book&#39;s structure so that it can be used as a standalone alternative to the book or complementary code-along resource.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/livevideo/master-and-build-large-language-models&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/video-screenshot.webp?123&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Companion Book / Sequel&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mng.bz/lZ5B&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build A Reasoning Model (From Scratch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while a standalone book, can be considered as a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a pretrained model and implements different reasoning approaches, including inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, and distillation, to improve the model&#39;s reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;em&gt;Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mng.bz/lZ5B&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build A Reasoning Model (From Scratch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes a hands-on approach implementing these methods from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Exercises&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter of the book includes several exercises. The solutions are summarized in Appendix C, and the corresponding code notebooks are available in the main chapter folders of this repository (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/main/ch02/01_main-chapter-code/exercise-solutions.ipynb&quot;&gt;./ch02/01_main-chapter-code/exercise-solutions.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the code exercises, you can download a free 170-page PDF titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/books/test-yourself-on-build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch&quot;&gt;Test Yourself On Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)&lt;/a&gt; from the Manning website. It contains approximately 30 quiz questions and solutions per chapter to help you test your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are you a student?&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Get started with the following resources:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/student-hub?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Student Hub page&lt;/a&gt; In this page, you will find beginner resources, Student packs and even ways to get a free cert voucher. This is one page you want to bookmark and check from time to time as we switch out content at least monthly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachers&lt;/strong&gt;: we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/main/for-teachers.md&quot;&gt;included some suggestions&lt;/a&gt; on how to use this curriculum. We&#39;d love your feedback &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions&quot;&gt;in our discussion forum&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aka.ms/student-page&quot;&gt;Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz. Then read the lecture and complete the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however, that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&quot;&gt;Microsoft Learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pedagogy&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned basic principles of data science, including ethical concepts, data preparation, different ways of working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world use cases of data science, and more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 10 week cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note about quizzes&lt;/strong&gt;: All quizzes are contained in the Quiz-App folder, for 40 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instruction in the &lt;code&gt;quiz-app&lt;/code&gt; folder. They are gradually being localized.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub Codespaces&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select + New codespace at the bottom on the pane. For more info, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace&quot;&gt;GitHub documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;VSCode Remote - Containers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode using the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started&quot;&gt;the getting started documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Under the hood, this will use the Remote-Containers: &lt;strong&gt;Clone Repository in Container Volume...&lt;/strong&gt; command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/&quot;&gt;Volumes&lt;/a&gt; are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Clone this repository to your local filesystem.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Press F1 and select the &lt;strong&gt;Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...&lt;/strong&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Offline access&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can run this documentation offline by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docsify.js.org/#/&quot;&gt;Docsify&lt;/a&gt;. Fork this repo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart&quot;&gt;install Docsify&lt;/a&gt; on your local machine, then in the root folder of this repo, type &lt;code&gt;docsify serve&lt;/code&gt;. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jupyter notebooks for the code samples of the book &quot;Deep Learning with Python&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Companion notebooks for Deep Learning with Python&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-third-edition?a_aid=keras&amp;amp;a_bid=76564dff&quot;&gt;Deep Learning with Python, third edition (2025)&lt;/a&gt; by Francois Chollet and Matthew Watson. In addition, you will also find the legacy notebooks for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&amp;amp;a_bid=76564dff&quot;&gt;second edition (2021)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&amp;amp;a_bid=76564dff&quot;&gt;first edition (2017)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For readability, these notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles, and omit everything else in the book: text paragraphs, figures, and pseudocode. &lt;strong&gt;If you want to be able to follow what&#39;s going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side by side with your copy of the book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Running the code&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We recommend running these notebooks on &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.google&quot;&gt;Colab&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a hosted runtime with all the dependencies you will need. You can also, run these notebooks locally, either by setting up your own Jupyter environment, or using Colab&#39;s instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html&quot;&gt;running locally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By default, all notebooks will run on Colab&#39;s free tier GPU runtime, which is sufficient to run all code in this book. Chapter 8-18 chapters will benefit from a faster GPU if you have a Colab Pro subscription. You can change your runtime type using &lt;strong&gt;Runtime -&amp;gt; Change runtime type&lt;/strong&gt; in Colab&#39;s dropdown menus.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing a backend&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The code for third edition is written using Keras 3. As such, it can be run with JAX, TensorFlow or PyTorch as a backend. To set the backend, update the backend in the cell at the top of the colab that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;import os
os.environ[&quot;KERAS_BACKEND&quot;] = &quot;jax&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This must be done only once per session before importing Keras. If you are in the middle running a notebook, you will need to restart the notebook session and rerun all relevant notebook cells. This can be done in using &lt;strong&gt;Runtime -&amp;gt; Restart Session&lt;/strong&gt; in Colab&#39;s dropdown menus.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Using Kaggle data&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book uses datasets and model weights provided by Kaggle, an online Machine Learning community and platform. You will need to create a Kaggle login to run Kaggle code in this book; instructions are given in Chapter 8.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For chapters that need Kaggle data, you can login to Kaggle once per session when you hit the notebook cell with &lt;code&gt;kagglehub.login()&lt;/code&gt;. Alternately, you can set up your Kaggle login information once as Colab secrets:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/&lt;/a&gt; and sign in.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/settings&quot;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/settings&lt;/a&gt; and generate a Kaggle API key.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Open the secrets tab in Colab by clicking the key icon on the left.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Add two secrets, &lt;code&gt;KAGGLE_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KAGGLE_KEY&lt;/code&gt; with the username and key you just created.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Following this approach you will only need to copy your Kaggle secret key once, though you will need to allow each notebook to access your secrets when running the relevant Kaggle code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pathway&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;AI Pipelines&lt;/strong&gt; allow you to quickly put in production AI applications that offer &lt;strong&gt;high-accuracy RAG and AI enterprise search at scale&lt;/strong&gt; using the most &lt;strong&gt;up-to-date knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; available in your data sources. It provides you ready-to-deploy &lt;strong&gt;LLM (Large Language Model) App Templates&lt;/strong&gt;. You can test them on your own machine and deploy on-cloud (GCP, AWS, Azure, Render,...) or on-premises.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The apps connect and sync (all new data additions, deletions, updates) with data sources on your &lt;strong&gt;file system, Google Drive, Sharepoint, S3, Kafka, PostgreSQL, real-time data APIs&lt;/strong&gt;. They come with no infrastructure dependencies that would need a separate setup. They include &lt;strong&gt;built-in data indexing&lt;/strong&gt; enabling vector search, hybrid search, and full-text search - all done in-memory, with cache.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Application Templates&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The application templates provided in this repo scale up to &lt;strong&gt;millions of pages of documents&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of them are optimized for simplicity, some are optimized for amazing accuracy. Pick the one that suits you best. You can use it out of the box, or change some steps of the pipeline - for example, if you would like to add a new data source, or change a Vector Index into a Hybrid Index, it&#39;s just a one-line change.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;td&gt;A real-time document indexing pipeline for RAG that acts as a vector store service. It performs live indexing on your documents (PDF, DOCX,...) from a connected data source (files, Google Drive, Sharepoint,...). It can be used with any frontend, or integrated as a retriever backend for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pathway.com/blog/langchain-integration&quot;&gt;Langchain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pathway.com/blog/llamaindex-pathway&quot;&gt;Llamaindex&lt;/a&gt; application.

&lt;p&gt;The apps can be run as &lt;strong&gt;Docker containers&lt;/strong&gt;, and expose an &lt;strong&gt;HTTP API&lt;/strong&gt; to connect the frontend. To allow quick testing and demos, some app templates also include an optional Streamlit UI which connects to this API.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The apps rely on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway&quot;&gt;Pathway Live Data framework&lt;/a&gt; for data source synchronization and for serving API requests (Pathway is a standalone Python library with a Rust engine built into it). They bring you a &lt;strong&gt;simple and unified application logic&lt;/strong&gt; for back-end, embedding, retrieval, LLM tech stack. There is no need to integrate and maintain separate modules for your Gen AI app: &lt;del&gt;Vector Database (e.g. Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) + Cache (e.g. Redis) + API Framework (e.g. Fast API)&lt;/del&gt;. Pathway&#39;s default choice of &lt;strong&gt;built-in vector index&lt;/strong&gt; is based on the lightning-fast &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch&quot;&gt;usearch&lt;/a&gt; library, and &lt;strong&gt;hybrid full-text indexes&lt;/strong&gt; make use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy&quot;&gt;Tantivy&lt;/a&gt; library. Everything works out of the box.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/main/examples/pipelines/&quot;&gt;App templates&lt;/a&gt; in this repo contains a README.md with instructions on how to run it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also find &lt;a href=&quot;https://pathway.com/developers/templates/&quot;&gt;more ready-to-run code templates&lt;/a&gt; on the Pathway website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of guides and examples for the Gemma open models from Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the Gemma Cookbook&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of guides and examples for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/&quot;&gt;Google Gemma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Get started with the Gemma models&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gemma is a family of lightweight, generative artificial intelligence (AI) open models, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. The Gemma model family includes:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Gemma&lt;br /&gt; The core models of the Gemma family. 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card&quot;&gt;Gemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For a variety of text generation tasks and can be further tuned for specific use cases&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card_2&quot;&gt;Gemma 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Higher-performing and more efficient, available in 2B, 9B, 27B parameter sizes&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card_3&quot;&gt;Gemma 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Longer context window and handling text and image input, available in 1B, 4B, 12B and 27B parameter sizes&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/gemma-3n/model_card&quot;&gt;Gemma 3n&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Designed for efficient execution on low-resource devices. Handling text, image, video, and audio input, available in E2B and E4B parameter sizes&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/codegemma&quot;&gt;CodeGemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fine-tuned for a variety of coding tasks&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/model-card&quot;&gt;PaliGemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Vision Language Model&lt;br /&gt; For a deeper analysis of images and provide useful insights&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/model-card-2&quot;&gt;PaliGemma 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; VLM which incorporates the capabilities of the Gemma 2 models&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/recurrentgemma&quot;&gt;RecurrentGemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427&quot;&gt;Griffin&lt;/a&gt; architecture&lt;br /&gt; For a variety of text generation tasks&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/shieldgemma/model_card&quot;&gt;ShieldGemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fine-tuned for evaluating the safety of text prompt input and text output responses against a set of defined safety policies&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/shieldgemma/model_card_2&quot;&gt;ShieldGemma 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fine-tuned on Gemma 3&#39;s 4B IT checkpoint for image safety classification&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/datagemma&quot;&gt;DataGemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fine-tuned for using Data Commons to address AI hallucinations&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations/medgemma&quot;&gt;MedGemma&lt;/a&gt; The MedGemma collection contains Google&#39;s most capable open models for medical text and image comprehension, built on Gemma 3. Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building healthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma comes in two variants: a 4B multimodal version and a 27B text-only version.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can find the Gemma models on the Hugging Face Hub, Kaggle, Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Garden, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.nvidia.com&quot;&gt;ai.nvidia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
